## API Integration & Data Visualization – OpenWeatherMap


About the Project :

This project focuses on API integration and data visualization using Python. The goal was to fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and present it in an informative, easy-to-understand format using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The task involved working with API requests, handling JSON responses, processing data, and visualizing key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Key Features :

Fetching Data from OpenWeatherMap API – Retrieves weather data for a specified location.
Data Processing & Cleaning – Extracts relevant details from the API response.
Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn – Graphs and charts to display temperature trends, humidity levels, etc.
User Input Handling – Allows users to specify cities for real-time weather updates.
Error Handling – Manages API request failures and incorrect inputs gracefully.

How It Works :

API Setup: A request is sent to OpenWeatherMap using an API key.
Data Extraction: The response is parsed to extract weather metrics.
Data Visualization: The extracted data is plotted into readable graphs.
User Interaction: Users can input city names to fetch weather data dynamically.

Technologies Used :

Python
Requests (for API calls)
JSON (for data parsing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
Pandas (for structured data handling)

Installation & Usage :

Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests matplotlib seaborn pandas
Run the script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python openweathermap.py
Enter a city name and view the weather data with visualizations.

Challenges Faced & Learnings :

Handling API Responses – Parsing JSON and extracting only useful information.
Visualization Techniques – Choosing the best graph formats for weather data.
Error Handling – Managing incorrect API keys, invalid city names, and request failures.
Library Installation Issues – Troubleshooting missing modules and dependencies.

Future Improvements :

Add more weather parameters like air quality index (AQI).
Build a dashboard with real-time updates.
Integrate with Tkinter or Flask for a GUI/web-based interface.

Conclusion :

This project was a hands-on learning experience in API integration, data processing, and visualization. By working with OpenWeatherMap, I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with real-world data and present it in a meaningful way.
